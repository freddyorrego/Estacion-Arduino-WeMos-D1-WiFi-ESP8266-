🌦️ Educational Weather Station

I always wanted to have a weather station at home, but like many others, the high cost was a barrier. That led me to take on a challenge: building a low-cost weather station using easily accessible components that could send data to a website.

🛠️ Steps I followed:
- Selected and acquired the necessary components. For my station, I used a WeMos R1 D1 (compatible), which is a development board with built-in WiFi, a DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor, an analog UV sensor GUVA-S12SD, a BH1750 light intensity sensor, and optionally a 16x2 LCD.
- Connected the sensors to the WeMos R1 D1 board following the manufacturer's instructions.
- Wrote the code to read sensor data, process it, and filter out anomalous or erroneous values.
- Optionally connected an LCD to display the data clearly and legibly (only during testing phase).
- Chose a power source—solar panel and battery in my case, though it could also be powered via a phone charger.
- Wrote the HTML code and created the database to store the information on a website.
